            <h2>Behind the Mask</h2>
            <h3>The Man and the Mission</h3>
            <p>Bruce Wayne, after witnessing the tragic loss of his parents, vowed to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Through years of rigorous training and the use of his wealth and intelligence, he became Gotham’s greatest protector — Batman.</p>
            <p>Beyond his battles with villains, Batman represents resilience, morality, and the human ability to rise above pain. He’s not a hero because of superpowers but because of his relentless will to do what’s right.</p>
